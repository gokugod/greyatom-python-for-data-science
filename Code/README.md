### Project Overview

 This project is based on student management system.


### Learnings from the project

 i will learn how to manipulate list ,dictionaries and strings.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Basically i createde two seperate lists and  concenate them and created a new list and in that new list i append an element and in this way we created a list which has list of all students.In second step we created a dictionary and dictionary has two parameters key and value here our key is subject and value is marks and then we stores all marks in a single varible and add them together and find percentile later. Now in third step we find out topper who scored highest marks in maths and then we convert it's name in upper case and the store it on a separate varible and at last we print it.


### Challenges faced

 i got stuck in extracting key values from the dictionary and then  add together to find total.
